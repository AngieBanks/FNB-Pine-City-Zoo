                    <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>

                    <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, with males reaching heights up to 5 meters (16.5 feet), about as tall as a one story building! Their long necks and legs, unique spotted coats, and calm nature make them one of the most beloved animals in the wild.</p>

                    <p>A giraffe's long neck allows it to reach leaves high up in trees that other animals canâ€™t access, especially from their favorite acacia trees. Their prehensile tongue can stretch nearly 45 cm (18 inches) to grasp leaves, pods, and even thorny twigs.</p>

                    <p>Despite their size, giraffes are gentle animals that usually move slowly, unless startled. When they need to, they can gallop at speeds up to 50 km/h (31 mph), using their neck like a pendulum to balance as they run.</p>

                    <p>Giraffes have large hearts, up to 11 kg or 25 lbs that pump blood all the way up their long necks with high pressure. Their horns, called ossicones, are covered in skin and are more prominent in males. These are used during "necking" battles dominance fights where males swing their necks and clash.</p>

                    <p>Females give birth after a 16 month pregnancy. A single calf is born and can usually walk within an hour. Giraffes live in loose social groups and are usually peaceful and shy by nature.</p>
