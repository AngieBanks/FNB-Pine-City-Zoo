                    <h3>KOALAS</h3>

                    <p>Koalas are iconic marsupials native to Australia, best known for their fluffy ears, large noses, and sleepy, tree-dwelling lifestyle. Though often called “koala bears,” they are not bears at all, but rather marsupials—animals that carry and nurse their young in pouches.</p>

                    <p>Koalas are expert climbers and spend most of their lives perched in eucalyptus trees, which also make up the majority of their diet. Eucalyptus leaves are low in nutrients and slightly toxic, but koalas have a specialized digestive system that breaks down the toxins and extracts enough energy to survive.</p>

                    <p>Due to their limited diet, koalas conserve energy by sleeping or resting for up to 20 hours a day. They are solitary animals and communicate with each other using deep grunts, snores, and squeaks, especially during mating season.</p>

                    <p>A female koala gives birth to a single joey after about 35 days. The joey is the size of a jellybean and will crawl into its mother’s pouch, where it continues to develop for several months before venturing out.</p>

                        <li>Their large noses help them smell which eucalyptus leaves are best to eat.</li>
                        <li>Each koala’s fur smells slightly like eucalyptus, nature’s built-in air freshener.</li>
