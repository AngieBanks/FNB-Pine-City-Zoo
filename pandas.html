                <h3>PANDAS</h3>

                <p>The giant panda is a bear species native to China, easily recognized by its distinctive black and white fur. Though classified as a carnivore, its diet is almost entirely bamboo, which makes up about 99% of what it eats. Adult pandas weigh between 100 and 150 kilograms and grow up to 1.5 meters long. They are generally solitary animals, coming together only during mating season.</p>

                <h4>Habitat</h4>
                <p>Giant pandas live in mountainous regions with temperate forests, where bamboo is plentiful. They are found at elevations from 1,200 to 3,100 meters.</p>

                <h4>Population and Conservation</h4>
                <p>There are roughly 1,864 wild giant pandas today. Thanks to dedicated conservation efforts, their status was improved from "Endangered" to "Vulnerable," though threats like habitat loss and climate change remain.</p>

                <h4>Reproduction and Lifespan</h4>
                <p>Female pandas are fertile only 2â€“3 days a year. After a gestation of about five months, they usually give birth to one or two tiny cubs. Cubs are dependent on their mothers for up to 2.5 years before becoming independent.</p>

                <h4>Behavior and Diet</h4>
                <p>Pandas spend up to 14 hours a day eating bamboo up to 38 kilograms daily. They are strong swimmers and skilled climbers. Though generally gentle, they can defend themselves if threatened.</p>

                <h4>Cultural Significance</h4>
                <p>The giant panda is a beloved symbol of wildlife conservation worldwide and holds special cultural importance in China. It has appeared on coins and was one of the mascots of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.</p>
