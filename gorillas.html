                    <h3>GORILLAS</h3>

                    <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, known for their powerful build, deep intelligence, and strong social bonds. With broad chests, muscular arms, and expressive faces, they are both impressive and endearing to watch.</p>

                    <p>There are two species of gorillas: the Eastern and Western gorilla. Eastern gorillas tend to be larger with darker, longer hair, while Western lowland gorillas have shorter coats and may have a reddish tint on their heads. Adult males are known as <strong>silverbacks</strong> due to the distinctive patch of silvery-white hair that appears on their backs once they mature.</p>

                    <p>Males can weigh up to 200 kg (440 lbs) and stand between 1.2 and 1.7 meters tall (4â€“5.5 feet) when upright. Females are typically about half their size. Gorillas walk on all fours using their knuckles but can stand and walk short distances on two legs.</p>

                    <p>These intelligent primates live in family groups led by a dominant silverback who protects and guides the troop. They are primarily herbivores, eating leaves, stems, fruit, and bamboo shoots. Gorillas are also known to use tools in the wild and can express a wide range of emotions and social behaviors.</p>
