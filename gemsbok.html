                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>

                    <p>The Gemsbok is a striking antelope native to the arid regions of Southern Africa. With its bold black and white facial markings, powerful build, and long, spear like horns, it's one of the most visually impressive animals in the desert.</p>

                    <p>They are perfectly adapted to hot, dry environments, requiring very little water to survive. Gemsbok are social animals, usually seen in herds that roam across open plains in search of food and shade.</p>

                    <p>Both males and females have long, straight horns, up to 1.6 meters (5.2 feet) in length, which they use for protection and dominance displays. Despite their elegant appearance, Gemsbok are powerful fighters and can defend themselves successfully against predators like lions and hyenas.</p>

                    <p>Their tough hide and strong neck muscles help them survive harsh environments and fend off attacks. In local cultures, their horns and hides are used in traditional crafts and tools.</p>
