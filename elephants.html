                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>

                    <p>Meet the gentle giants of the wild elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, admired for their intelligence, strong social bonds, and emotional depth.</p>

                    <p>There are two main species of elephants: the African elephant (<em>Loxodonta africana</em>) and the Asian elephant (<em>Elephas maximus</em>). African elephants are generally larger, with bigger ears shaped like the continent of Africa, while Asian elephants have smaller, rounded ears.</p>

                    <p>They live in herds, led by a matriarch, an older female, and communicate using deep rumbles that can travel miles. Elephants use their trunks for breathing, smelling, drinking, trumpeting, and picking up objects. Their ivory tusks are actually elongated incisor teeth, used for digging and defense.</p>

                    <p>Elephants are herbivores and spend up to 16 hours a day eating grasses, roots, fruit, and bark. They are also known to shape the landscape around them by uprooting trees and creating waterholes used by other animals.</p>
