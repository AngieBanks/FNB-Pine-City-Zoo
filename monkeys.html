                <h3>MONKEYS</h3>

                <p>Monkeys are a fascinating and diverse group of primates found all around the world. They are generally divided into two groups: Old World monkeys, native to Africa and Asia, and New World monkeys, found in Central and South America. Most monkeys have tails, agile bodies, and are highly social animals.</p>

                <p>Monkeys are omnivores, eating a varied diet including fruits, seeds, insects, and small animals. They thrive in a wide range of habitats such as tropical rainforests, savannas, and mountainous regions.</p>

                <p>Many monkey species demonstrate impressive intelligence. Some use tools to find food, like sticks to extract insects from tree bark or rocks to crack nuts. They live in complex social groups with defined hierarchies and show cooperative behaviors within their troops.</p>
