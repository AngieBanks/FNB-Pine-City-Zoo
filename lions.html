                    <h3>LIONS</h3>

                    <p>Lions are among the most iconic animals in the world and are often referred to as the "kings of the jungle." These powerful big cats live in groups called prides, which usually consist of several females, their cubs, and a few dominant males. Lions are known for their strength, loud roar, and social behavior, which sets them apart from other big cats.</p>

                    <p>Male lions are distinguished by their thick manes, which can range from golden to dark brown or even black. The mane makes the male appear larger and serves both as protection during fights and as a visual signal of strength and health. Females, called lionesses, are smaller, lack manes, and do most of the hunting for the pride.</p>

                    <p>Lions are carnivores and primarily hunt large herbivores such as zebras, wildebeest, and buffalo. Working together in coordinated hunts, lionesses use stealth and teamwork to bring down prey, while males often defend the territory and the pride from rivals.</p>

                    <p>Lions are native to Africa, with a small population also found in the Gir Forest of India. They prefer open plains, savannas, and scrubland habitats where their tawny coats blend in well with the grass.</p>
