                <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>

                <p>Warthogs are medium-sized herbivores known for their large heads, prominent tusks, and distinctive facial "warts" which serve as protective bumps. They thrive in open and semi-open habitats like savannas, grasslands, and woodlands. A unique behavior is their habit of entering burrows backward, tusks facing outward, to defend themselves from predators.</p>

                <h4>Species</h4>
                <p>The genus Phacochoerus includes two species:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Common Warthog: widespread across sub-Saharan Africa.</li>
                    <li>Desert Warthog: found in arid regions of northern Kenya, Somalia, and eastern Ethiopia.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Physical Characteristics</h4>
                <p>Adults weigh between 50 and 150 kg and stand about 63.5 to 85 cm tall at the shoulder. Both males and females have tusks, but males' are larger and more curved, growing over 60 cm. Their sparse, bristly hair, coarse back mane, and tufted tail add to their rugged appearance. Males have more pronounced facial warts used as padding in fights.</p>

                <h4>Diet and Behavior</h4>
                <p>Primarily herbivorous, warthogs eat grasses, roots, berries, bark, and sometimes carrion. They use their snouts to dig for food and can survive without water for extended periods. Warthogs live in groups called sounders, mainly females and young, while males tend to be solitary except during mating season. They can run up to 30 mph when threatened and seek refuge in burrows.</p>

                <h4>Reproduction</h4>
                <p>Warthogs breed seasonally, typically in the late rainy or early dry season. Females give birth to litters of up to four piglets after a gestation of five to six months.</p>

                <h4>Conservation Status</h4>
                <p>The common warthog is classified as "Least Concern" by the IUCN, indicating a stable population, though some local populations face threats from habitat loss and hunting.</p>
